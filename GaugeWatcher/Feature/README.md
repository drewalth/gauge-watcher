# Feature

This folder houses app features/UIs and their reducers.

## Structure

Here's an example file structure for a feature called, "Settings":

```
MyCoolFeature/
├── SettingsFeature.swift
├── SettingsView.swift
```

I am still a little unsure about the preferred design language, but in the example above,
`SettingsFeature.swift` is the TCA reducer file. It might be better to name reducer files
as `SettingsReducer.swift` for clarity.
